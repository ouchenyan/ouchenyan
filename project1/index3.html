<h1>little tree</h1>
<h2>little silent Christmas tree</h2>
<h2>you are so little</h2>
<h2>you are more like a flower</h2>
<h2>who found you in the green forest</h2>
<h2>and were you very sorry to come away?</h2>
<h2>see i will comfort you</h2>
<h2>because you smell so sweetly</h2>
<h2>i will kiss your cool bark</h2>
<h2>and hug you safe and tight</h2>
<h2>just as your mother would,</h2>
<h2>only don't be afraid</h2>
<h2>look the spangles</h2>
<h2>that sleep all the year in a dark box</h2>
<h2>dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,</h2>
<h2>the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,</h2>
<h2>put up your little arms</h2>
<h2>and i'll give them all to you to hold</h2>
<h2>every finger shall have its ring</h2>
<h2>and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy</h2>
<h2>then when you're quite dressed</h2>
<h2>you'll stand in the window for everyone to ee</h2>
<h2>and how they'll stare!</h2>
<h2>oh but you'll be very proud</h2>
<h2>and my little sister and i will take hands</h2>
<h2>and looking up at our beautiful tree</h2>
<h2>we'll dance and sing</h2>
